During my internship at **AWS/First cloud journey program** from **September 8, 2025** to **December 12, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in **learning AWS services, as well as applying learned knowledge to a group project on FinTech**, through which I improved my **teamwork skills and specifically achieved desired skills such as Docker, DevOps, and applying AWS services to support practical project implementation**.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

### Needs Improvement

- Strengthen discipline and strictly comply with the rules and regulations of the company or any organization
- Improve problem-solving thinking
- Enhance communication skills in both daily interactions and professional contexts, including handling situations effectively
- **In-depth Learning Ability:** Need to dedicate time to "Deep Dive" into the core principles of AWS services instead of just stopping at "How-to" knowledge, to enable better debugging and system optimization.
- **Proactive Contribution:** Need to be bolder in proposing ideas for improvement or applying new technologies (such as Serverless, Automation) to the project, rather than just focusing on completing assigned tasks.
