# Report: “WORKSHOP: DATA SCIENCE ON AWS”

### Event Objectives

- Share AWS AI services
- Demonstrate deploying AI models using Amazon SageMaker
- Show how to deploy models and access them via APIs

### Speakers

- **Van Hoang Kha** - Cloud Solutions Architect, AWS User Group Leader
- **Bach Doan Vuong** - Cloud Developer Engineer, AWS Community Builder

### Highlights

#### **1. The Importance of Cloud Computing in Data Science**

- Opened with an affirmation of cloud computing's pivotal role in modern data science, especially in processing and storing large datasets.
- **Cloud vs. On-premise:**
  - **Cloud:** Superior scalability, deployment agility, and flexible cost model (OPEX).
  - **On-premise:** High upfront infrastructure cost (CAPEX), difficult to scale resources instantly, and maintenance burden.
- **AWS** provides an "End-to-End" platform for the Data Science pipeline: from collection, storage, and processing to training and model operation.

#### **2. The 3-Layer Stack of AWS AI**

AWS designs its AI ecosystem in 3 distinct layers to serve diverse needs:

**Layer 1: AI Services (Pre-managed AI Services)**
> _Suitable for: App Developers not specialized in ML._

- Intelligent APIs pre-trained by AWS.
- Quickly integrate into applications to add AI features immediately.
- **Key Services:**
  - **Amazon Comprehend:** Text and sentiment analysis.
  - **Amazon Translate:** Automated translation.
  - **Amazon Textract:** Identify and extract data from text/images.
  - **Amazon Rekognition:** Image and video analysis.
  - **Amazon Bedrock:** Gateway to powerful Foundation Models.

**Layer 2: ML Services (Amazon SageMaker)**
> _Suitable for: Data Scientists & ML Engineers._

- Comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Machine Learning.
- Provides tools for every step:
  - **Data Wrangler:** Data preparation.
  - **Feature Store:** Feature repository.
  - **SageMaker Autopilot:** Automated training (AutoML).
  - **Model Registry:** Model lifecycle management.

**Layer 3: AI Infrastructure (ML Infrastructure)**
> _Suitable for: Expert Practitioners needing deep optimization._

- Provides the most powerful computing resources:
  - **EC2 Instances (P5, G6, Trn1...):** Specialized chipsets for training/inference.
  - **EKS/ECS:** Run AI workloads on container platforms.

#### **3. Powerful Support Tools for Students**

1.  **Amazon SageMaker:** The best place to start learning and practicing industry-standard ML workflows.
2.  **Amazon Comprehend:** Powerful tool for NLP tasks like review analysis, text classification.
3.  **Amazon Translate:** Supports building multilingual applications at low cost.
4.  **Amazon Textract:** Effective solution for digitizing data from paper documents.

#### **4. Demo & Practice**

- **Demo 1: No-code ML with SageMaker Canvas**
  - The speaker demonstrated how to create a prediction model without writing any code using a visual drag-and-drop interface.
  - **Lesson:** Enables non-experts (Business Analysts) to apply AI as well.

- **Demo 2: Deploy Model as an API Service**
  - The process of deploying a trained model to a SageMaker Endpoint and exposing it via API Gateway.
  - **Lesson:** Understand the process of "Productionizing" an AI model for end-users.

### Event Experience

The workshop was a truly valuable experience, helping me systematize my knowledge of AI/ML on the Cloud platform.

- **Systems Thinking:** Understanding the 3 distinct layers helps me choose the right tool for the right problem, avoiding "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut".
- **Real-world Perspective:** Visual demos clearly illustrated the path from a notebook file to a functioning real-world API service.
- **Motivation:** Seeing the strong support AWS offers to the community and students through Free Tier programs and learning materials.
