# Summary Report: "AI-Driven Development Life Cycle: Reimagining Software Engineering"

### Event Objectives

Explore how AI is transforming the entire software development lifecycle, from planning to deployment. Learn how to integrate AI to increase productivity and focus on high-value creative tasks.

### Event Information

- **Time:** 2:00 PM - 4:30 PM, Friday, October 3rd, 2025
- **Location:** AWS Event Hall, L26 Bitexco Tower, HCMC
- **Speakers:** Toan Huynh, My Nguyen

### Key Highlights

#### 1. AI in Development - Outcomes

AI adoption brings:
- **Velocity** - Reduce time-to-market
- **Quality** - Meet usability & reliability expectations
- **Market Responsiveness** - React quickly to market changes
- **Innovation** - Drive innovation
- **Developer Engagement** - Increase developer satisfaction
- **Productivity** - Increase value, reduce costs

#### 2. Challenges with AI Development

**AI-Managed:** Unreliable, hard to explain, lacks flexibility

**AI-Assisted:** Not truly effective, manual inefficiencies, technical debt accumulation

#### 3. AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)

**Core Concept:**
- **AI as Collaborator:** AI assists developers, humans control critical decisions
- **Human-Centric:** Developers remain central, AI enhances not replaces
- **Accelerated Delivery:** Development cycles reduced from weeks/months to hours/days

**Two phases:**
1. **Inception:** Build Context → User Stories → Plan
2. **Construction:** Domain Model → Generate code → Deploy with IaaC

#### 4. 5-Stage Sequential Process

1. Product Owner → 2. Architect (Design) → 3. Architect (Construction) → 4. Engineer (POC) → 5. Engineer (MVP)

#### 5. Anti-Patterns - 7 Things to Avoid

1. Don't single-shot multi-step problems
2. Maximize semantics-to-token ratio
3. Refresh context strategically
4. Control AI over-reach
5. Model knows old better than new
6. Brownfield needs special context building
7. Think surgical precision

#### 6. Amazon Q Developer

**Prompt Structure:** Role → Plan (markdown with checkboxes) → Task

**Example:** Build travel booking app with AI integration

**Workflow:** Create folder → User stories → Clarification → Checkbox → Review → Execute

#### 7. Kiro - AI-Powered Coding Assistant

**Kiro** is AWS's AI coding assistant with 4 key features:

1. **Agent Hooks:** Auto-trigger tasks on events (file save), generate docs/tests/optimize
2. **VS Code Compatible:** Support plugins, themes, settings
3. **Claude Models:** Sonnet 3.7/4 with powerful reasoning
4. **Enterprise Security:** Built & operated by AWS

**Advantages:** High automation, context-aware, documentation-driven, enterprise-ready

### Key Takeaways

Participating in the **"GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization"** workshop was an incredibly enriching experience, providing me with a comprehensive perspective on modernizing applications and databases using contemporary methods and tools. Some notable highlights include:

#### Learning from highly skilled speakers

- Speakers from AWS and major technology organizations shared **best practices** in modern application design.
- Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of how to apply **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Event-Driven Architecture** to large-scale projects.

#### Hands-on technical exposure

- Participating in **event storming** sessions helped me visualize how to **model business processes** into domain events.
- Learned how to **split microservices** and define **bounded contexts** to manage complexity in large systems.
- Understood the trade-offs between **synchronous and asynchronous communication**, as well as integration patterns like **pub/sub, point-to-point, and streaming**.

#### Leveraging modern tools

- Directly explored **Amazon Q Developer**, an AI tool supporting the SDLC from planning to maintenance.
- Learned how to **automate code transformation** and pilot serverless with **AWS Lambda**, thereby enhancing development productivity.

#### Lessons learned

- Applying DDD and event-driven patterns helps reduce **coupling** while increasing **scalability** and **resilience** for systems.
- Modernization strategies require a **phased approach** and **ROI measurement**; rushing to transform the entire system should be avoided.
- AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can **boost productivity** when integrated into the current development workflow.
