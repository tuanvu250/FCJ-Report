#### Overview

Initialize an object storage (S3 Bucket) to hold original documents (PDF, Word, Text). This acts as the "Source of Truth" that the Knowledge Base will access to read, analyze, and synchronize knowledge for the AI. You can store knowledge related to your field to use in creating your own personal assistant or Chatbot.

#### Data Preparation

We will create an S3 Bucket to store original documents, acting as the knowledge source for the Chatbot.

**Step 1. Create S3 Bucket**

- Access the [S3](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/get-started?region=us-east-1) service from the search bar.
- **AWS Region:** Select `United States (N. Virginia us-east-1)`.

    - **Bucket Type:** Click `General purpose`
    - **Bucket name:** Enter `rag-workshop-demo`
    - **Object Ownership:** Keep default `ACLs disabled`.
