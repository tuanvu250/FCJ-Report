#### Overview

According to AWS's new policy, Foundation Models are often automatically enabled. However, for third-party partner models like **Anthropic (Claude)**, first-time users in a new Region must declare usage information (Use Case) to be able to invoke the model.

Ensure your AWS account has permission to access and use the **Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet** model. This is a mandatory step to avoid `AccessDenied` errors when the Chatbot operates later. If this is the first time you are using this model in a new Region, you need to declare the intended use (Use Case).

#### Access Check

We will perform a quick test (Test Run) to ensure your account is ready.

In the search bar, access the [Amazon Bedrock](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/overview).
