### Overview

In this workshop, we will focus on building an intelligent AI assistant capable of "reading and understanding" and answering questions based on proprietary enterprise data (RAG technique).

The main objective is to establish a fully automated and serverless data processing workflow, consisting of the following steps:

1.  **Ingestion:** Loading source documents into the system.
2.  **Indexing:** Converting text into vectors and storing them for retrieval.
3.  **Retrieval & Generation:** Configuring the AI model to search for relevant information and generate answers to user questions.

> 💡 **Highlight:** This solution allows you to **eliminate the need to manage any server infrastructure**, optimizing costs and operational time.
