> Here you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program, helping the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always ready to support me when I face difficulties, even outside of working hours. The workspace is neat and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I have a small suggestion regarding the work schedule arrangement. Currently, booking a slot to go to the office is sometimes difficult due to limited quantity, leading to members of the same group having little opportunity to meet in person to exchange ideas. I hope that in the future, the program can consider establishing a more fixed schedule for each group, helping us have space and time to interact, bond, and work together more effectively instead of having to "fight" for slots as currently.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor guides very in detail, explains clearly when I don't understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. What I am most impressed with is the enthusiasm and dedication of the Mentors. Whenever I or others have questions, they always respond extremely quickly with thorough, in-depth explanations that are still very easy to understand. This "timely" and "focused" support not only helps us untangle technical issues but also gives us great motivation to be more confident in the project implementation process. The team admin supports procedures, documents, and creates conditions for me to work favorably. I appreciate the mentor allowing me to try and handle problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The work I was assigned is suitable for the knowledge I learned at school, while also expanding into new areas that I had never approached before. Thanks to that, I both consolidated my foundational knowledge and learned additional practical skills. In particular, the greatest value I received is the opportunity to "fight in reality" with a specific project from start to finish. This is a huge plus for my capability profile (portfolio) later, because these practical implementation experiences are valuable luggage that I can hardly find just through books or ordinary subject projects.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The internship period at FCJ was truly a valuable "crash course" for me. I not only became more proficient in project management tools and the Git Flow process but also trained my teamwork thinking methodically. Moreover, the sharing sessions from Mentors about career paths and technology trends helped me have a clearer view and better orientation for my future development path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but is still fun. When there is an urgent project, everyone tries together, supporting without distinguishing positions. This helps me feel like I am part of the collective, even though I am just an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company supports internship allowances and creates conditions for flexible time when necessary. In addition, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a big plus.

### Additional Questions

- What did you find **most satisfying** during your internship?
  - Not only professional knowledge, the thing that makes me most satisfied is the close companionship and wholehearted support from the Mentors. Besides that, being able to apply knowledge to real projects helps me mature a lot.
- What do you think the company **should improve** for future interns?
  - I hope the office work schedule registration system will be improved to be more flexible, or have a priority mechanism for project groups to ensure everyone has space for direct discussion, increasing connectivity for the team.
- If recommending to a friend, would you **suggest they intern here**? Why or why not?
  - 100% yes. This is an ideal environment for students to "step out of their comfort zone", practice real-world problem-solving thinking, and get used to professional working styles right while still sitting in school.
