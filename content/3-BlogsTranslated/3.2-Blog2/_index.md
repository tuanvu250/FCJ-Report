Are you looking to apply AI to optimize administrative tasks and enhance user productivity?

In the constantly evolving digital landscape, the success of an enterprise's End-User Computing (EUC) strategy depends on the ability of end users to access and use services effectively.
This interactive session will demonstrate how you can leverage Amazon Bedrock's agentic AI combined with Amazon WorkSpaces and Amazon CloudWatch.
These tools help automate administrative tasks and provide actionable insights from key metrics and logs.

During the session, attendees will be introduced to critical EUC strategies and learn how AI can transform their workflows. You will discover how Amazon Bedrock helps simplify complex processes, giving administrators the tools they need to increase performance. Additionally, hands-on labs with Amazon CloudWatch will teach you how to collect crucial data - including user connectivity, platforms, and IP addresses. Through Amazon Bedrock, you will analyze data to derive insights that help optimize end-user operations.

This session not only provides in-depth knowledge but is also a practical learning experience. Attendees will gain a clear understanding of how to integrate AI and CloudWatch into their existing frameworks. Whether you are an IT professional, system administrator, or decision-maker, this is an opportunity to elevate your EUC strategy and ensure both admins and users benefit from optimized tools and processes.

This _builders session_ takes place on July 16th at 9:15 AM EDT at the Javits Convention Center.
