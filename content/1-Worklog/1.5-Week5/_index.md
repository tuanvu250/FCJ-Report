### Week 5 Objectives:

- **Containerization**: Master **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and deploy containerized applications on **AWS ECS**.
- **Data Lake Architecture**: Build a complete Data Lake with **S3**, **AWS Glue** (Catalog), and **Athena** (Analytics).
- **NoSQL Deep Dive**: Hands-on deep dive with **Amazon DynamoDB** (Partition/Sort Key, GSI/LSI).
- **DB Comparison**: Detailed comparison of architecture and performance between **Amazon RDS** and **Amazon Aurora**.
- **Analytics Optimization**: Optimize costs and performance for big data queries.
